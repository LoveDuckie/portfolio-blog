# Overview

In this blog I will cover what is requird for installing and configuring `nvm` (Node Version Manager)

## What is Node Version Manager?

As the name might suggest, it is a tool for installing and managing multiple side-loaded installations of NodeJS.

## Why use Node Version Manager?

As a developer, you'll likely find yourself working on various projects or code repositories that target different versions of NodeJS for one reason or another.

It could be that one code project uses legacy libraries that use (now) deprecated language features. The inverse could also be true, in that you could be working on a more modern project where certain features are only available in the latest version of the NodeJS runtime.

Another way to look at it, is that you could use NVM as a safe way of upgrading or migrating a project ot the latest version of the NodeJS runtime.

If you didn't have NVM, you would find yourself having to manually install and uninstall versions of NodeJS
